The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">var foo = &#39;bar&#39;</code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Mac setup","date":"October 21, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/mac-setup/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/hi-folks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings"}}}}
